# stealth-timer

a work in progress

# To Do:

## BUGS

timeDisplay will sometimes show 1 second left when countdown hits zero

## FEATURES

* Multifunctional play-pause-stop glyphs on timer
* make displayCheckmark() and hideCheckmark() html, I can pass it into whatToDoNext() callback of Countdown and flash it on Interval
* Have reset button visible on paused timer
* Better UI: More Padding
